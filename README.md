# A standard Chess implementation

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Javran/sxako.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/Javran/sxako)

This is a toy project to implement standard Chess for fun.

The project begins with just the concept of [bitboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard#Standard),
and gradually we'll explore known designs, learn and adapt them into this library.

Project status: implementation is complete, tests are pending.

Potential future plans:

- Support UCI protocol therefore communication with Chess engines.
- Support PGN files.
- Solve well-known endgames with "textbook techniques" (in contrast to brute-forcing a shortest mating / drawing line)
