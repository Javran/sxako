  TODO: parsing PGN file.

  We might need to break parsing down into two steps:

  - parsing the file literally.
  - interpret movetext following along FEN.

  Movetext has the problem that it can only be interpreted
  properly given current FEN. So instead of making parsing stateful
  (in the sense that we "validate" a movetext as we replay
  from starting FEN), we tries to interpret the result
  only after parsing is done.

  For a FEN record, we generate all plies in `Ply` datatype,
  and then come up with another type mapping all plies
  to short algebratic notation.
